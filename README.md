redesign tripit.com in 60min
==================

I really like this service and I'm using it a lot, but have found the design very noisy and hardly readable.

So I used the great Chrome extension Stylebot and tweaked the CSS for 60 minutes.  
This is the result, design focused on my data, nothing else.

For use, download Chrome extension [**Stylebot**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha/details).
